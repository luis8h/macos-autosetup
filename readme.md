Configuration files for this setup are located in my dotfiles repository.

## getting started
- run the installation scripts
- install [autoraise](https://github.com/sbmpost/AutoRaise) (note: it says double click on the .dmg file, this should not open anything, but mount the dmg file in the finder under Locactions, there you can find the .app file)
