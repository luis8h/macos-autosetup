Configuration files for this setup are located in my dotfiles repository.

## getting started
- run the installation scripts
- install [autoraise](https://github.com/sbmpost/AutoRaise) (note: it says double click on the .dmg file, this should not open anything, but mount the dmg file in the finder under Locactions, there you can find the .app file)
- add autoraise to login items

## IMPORTANT
- the iterm2 remap modifier trick does only work if it does not have permissions in apple system settings (otherwise window management will also use the other key...)
- disable in "privacy security -> Accessebility -> iterm (disable)"
